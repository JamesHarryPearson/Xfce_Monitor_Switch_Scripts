# Xfce_Monitor_Switch_Scripts
These scripts move windows between a lower monitor and an upper monitor.
Please alter these scripts to suit your personal monitor arrangement.
If you want to, you can post altered versions with these changes, and I'll try to include them in the repository.
If I'm slow to respond, it'll be because this is my first git hub repository.
